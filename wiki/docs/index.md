# Home

**go-home** is a lightweight bridge for home devices written in Go. It is designed to be modular, fast, and easy to deploy using Docker.

## Architecture
The system consists of two main parts:
1.  **Core Service**: Manages the state and logic.
2.  **Plugins**: Optional services (Bluetooth, HomeKit, etc.) that communicate via MQTT.
